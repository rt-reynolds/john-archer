    <h3>Sakamoto doesn't speak much English, so I'll give you a heads-up on how things work here.</h3></div>
    <div><p>See that blue dude outside? That's the man himself, Master Sakamoto.</p>
      <p>His family's thrived off Kyudo since before Japan was a country. He's WAY serious about this...</p>

    <div id="newbody"><p>First, you need to understand Sakamoto's heart is in the right place. He only goes so crazy over the little mistakes because he wants to make sure everyone keeps a level of respect for the art.
